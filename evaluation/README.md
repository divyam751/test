### You haven't been taught Cypress to run the test cases locally; you can see the passed/ failed test cases and test errors on CP itself.

## Some Rules to follow:-

- Before writing a single line of code, please read the problem statement very carefully.
- <span style=" color: red">Don't change the already given IDs or classes.</span>
- If you don't follow these rules, you might not get any marks even if you do everything correctly.

## Problem statements

- Use `fetch` for API requests 
- irrespective of `sorting`, `filtering`, and `searching` for every fetch request limit your data to 5 per page <span style=" color: red">**(Hint: _page=`<pagenumber>`&_limit=5)**</span>

### <h1 style="color:#215dc8">index page</h1>

Your task is to build ***`Masai job Portal`*** app where different jobs are available, and you have to perform all `CURD` operations here, able to create, update, Read, and Delete jobs and also implement search functionality. Navbar has already been created no need to build it again.

<h4 style="color:#215dc8">
Problem 1. List of jobs on page load [3]
</h4>

On page `load`, a list of all `jobs` should be shown in the  `div#data-list-wrapper`. 

Expected markup (Jobs card list):
<!-- ![landingpage markup]() -->
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bofj9ZP.png"  style=" border-radius: 5px;" width="100%"/>
<figcaption align = "center"><b>landingpage markup</b></figcaption>
</figure>

- The `div.card` is a card appended to the div with `div.card-list`.
- In the above markup you can see only 5 cards are present on the first page and each page limit is 5.
- irrespective of `sorting`, `filtering`, and `searching` for every fetch request limit your data to 5 per page <span style=" color: red">**(Hint: _page=`<pagenumber>`&_limit=5)**</span>

Expected markup (example, single card div inside card-list div): 
<!-- ![jobMarkUp]() -->

    - button with `button.card-button` with *`Delete`* text 
        -  class= card-button
        -  data-id= id of the jobs

Problem 7. Sorting Jobs Based on 
</h4>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/t1AKmjU.png"  style=" border-radius: 5px;" width="100%"/>
<figcaption align = "center"><b>sort Low to high</b></figcaption>
</figure>


With the click of the button `#sort-low-to-high`, the jobs list should be sorted in ascending order based on their *package*.

With the click of the button `#sort-high-to-low`, the jobs list should be sorted in descending order based on their *package*.

You may use any approach of your choice for sorting. You may sort the available data, or you may make a new fetch request to the server and update the list. In case you want to fetch data, please use the [JSON Server documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

- irrespective of `sorting`, `filtering`, and `searching` for every fetch request limit your data to 5 per page <span style=" color: red">**(Hint: _page=`<pagenumber>`&_limit=5)**</span>

<figcaption align = "center"><b>Sort Based On publish date Newest first  </b></figcaption>
</figure>

When the button `#filter-Google` is clicked, the jobs list is expected to be filtered. It should only show the jobs whose `companyName` is ***`Google`***.

When the button `#filter-Microsoft` is clicked, the jobs list is expected to be filtered. It should only show the jobs whose `companyName` is ***`Microsoft`***.

When the button `#filter-capgemini` is clicked, the jobs list is expected to be filtered. It should only show the jobs whose `companyName` is ***`capgemini`***.

You may use any approach of your choice for filtering. You may filter the available data, or you may make a new fetch request to the server and update the list. In case you want to fetch data, please refer to the [JSON Server documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).


- <span style=" color: green">No need to complete functionality for simultaneously working of filter and sorting operations</span>

- irrespective of `sorting`, `filtering`, and `searching` for every fetch request limit your data to 5 per page <span style=" color: red">**(Hint: _page=`<pagenumber>`&_limit=5)**</span>

<h4 style="color:#215dc8">
Problem 9. Search by role/company name
</h4>

- To implement search functionality on top there is a select tag with *options* to search by companyName

Every time you have to select eighter option, next to it there is an input box (`input#search-by-input`) You have to enter the role/companyName name if it is included in the role/companyName's name respectively show those job only after clicking a search button(`button#search-by-button`)

You may use any approach of your choice for search functionality. You may use the available data or you may make a new fetch request to the server (with params as ***`?${role/companyNmae}_like=${role of job/companyName of job}`***) and update the list. In case you want to fetch data, please refer to the [JSON Server documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

### General guidelines

- The system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes to respond,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- We also request you not just submit it last minute
- Try to keep one submission at a time
- Use `${baseServerURL}/what-ever-route` for server url & not `localhost:9090/what-ever-route` in your solution. Failing to do so may cause all the tests to fail.
